# GraphFinal
Final project for my Data Structures class

This is an implementation of the Graph class in Java. It is able to preform Bread-First Traversal, Depth-First Traversal, and
Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm. 

Using the GraphGUI is pretty straight forward. When in doubt, click on a button and the instructions will be
displayed for it (except Clear Graph which I hope is self-explanatory)

Here are some things that are not explicitly stated in the GUI:
* In order to return the graph back to normal the graph after traversing though it just click on any button 
(except Clear Graph) or enter a space
* When finding the shortest cost between two vertices, the cost is displayed in the instructions JLabel
* You can name a vertex before adding it if you type textfield and then click where you want to add the vertex
* You can set the distance of an edge before adding it if you type in the textfield before adding the edge
